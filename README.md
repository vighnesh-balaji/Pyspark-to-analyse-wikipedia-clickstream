# Pyspark-to-analyse-wikipedia-clickstream

Wikipedia maintains a dataset called “Clickstream” that records clicks between pairs of linked Wikipedia articles. Because not all readers arrive at a Wikipedia article by clicking a link from another, the dataset also includes categories for clicks that originate outside of Wikipedia (e.g., external-search tracks all clicks coming from major search engines).

In this project, we’ll clean and analyze a sample of the English language Wikipedia’s Clickstream data from January 2018 using PySpark SQL.
